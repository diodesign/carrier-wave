## Overview

A simple JavaScript doodle, using [p5js](https://p5js.org/), illustrating [carrier-wave modulation](https://web.physics.ucsb.edu/~lecturedemonstrations/Composer/Pages/76.24.html).

## Try it live

* Play a recent version of the code [here](https://editor.p5js.org/diodesign/full/4QsUE7gM4) in your browser.
* Tweak and play a recent version of the code [here](https://editor.p5js.org/diodesign/sketches/4QsUE7gM4) in your browser.

## Future work

* Use the user's microphone or other sound input to modulate the carrier wave amplitude, rather than use a random value.
